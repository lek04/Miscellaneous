5) When I executed original.cpp, I was asked to input how many voters were surveyed. I typed in 100. Next I was asked how many 
would vote for Gavin. I inputed 125. Lastly, the program asked how many voted for Brian. I put in 250. The program outputed
the data of the election. 125% of the votes would go to Gavin, 250% would go to Brian and Brian will be the predicted winner.
This is unusual and nonsensical outputs as how could Gavin and Brian have votes that go beyond the amount of voters surveyed.
Also the percentages of voters are nonsensical as well. Both go above 100% which does not make sense.

6) In logic_error.cpp, the logic error is that depsite inputing that Gavin will get 25 votes and Brian will get 75 votes out
of the total 100 votes, the output will say that Gavin is the projected winner. This is because I incorrectly flipped the 
sign in the if statement so that it looked like this if(forGavin < forBrian); instead of if(forGavin > forBrian);. 
This error still allows the program to pass the compiler, but the intended outcome of the program was not achieved as it 
incorrectly named the predicted winner. 


7) In compile_error.cpp, the first compile error I put into the code was flipping the sign after a cin. It looked like this:
cin << numberSurveyed; instead of cin >> numberSurveyed;. The second compile error I put in was not capitlizing the b in the 
int forBrian. It looked like this: cin >> forbrian; instead of cin >> forBrian;. Both these errors prevented the code from 
passing through the compiler. The error messeges in the compiler described both errors. It said that identifier "forbrian"
was undefined which makes sense since it should be forBrian. The second messege said that no operator "<<"" matches the
operands which makes sense since it should be >>.
